              <h1>History and present</h1>
              <p>Argentina has been an outstanding exporter of confectionery peanut with an area of production that reached 400,000 hectares historically, 99 percent of them in the province of Córdoba. It settled among the first ten producers and the first three world exporters. 
<br />
<br />
From 1994, and as a result of the GATT Uruguay Round, the United States opened the import of peanut for limited volumes until the year 2000, and Argentina gained access to 78 percent of this annual volume. The United States also arranged a schedule for the reduction of the peanut production subsidy. As a result, there was an immediate reduction in the US production of more than 10 percent. 
<br />
<br />
The Argentine peanut industry saw this sign and began to make the necessary investments to satisfy the need to increase its volume and to improve the quality of its peanut. 
<br />
<br />
From there, with the creation of new selection plants, artificial drying plants, cells for peanut storage in boxes and a strong presence in international events, the industry started to undergo a revolution. This way, in 1996, our country came to export more than 300,000 tons of confectionery peanut, occupying the first place in the world. 
<br />
<br />
Cargill started exploring the peanut industry in 1992 by sowing peanut.  This resulted in Cargill Argentina's Peanut Operation.   It then imported combines, American drying systems and seeds for sowing. 
<br />
<br />
In 1994, the company built its Drying and Storage facility in the city of Alejandro Roca, in the province of Córdoba. 
<br />
<br />
From 1994 to 1996, Peanut Operation selected peanuts in third party installations and made exports to different countries. 
<br />
<br />
In April 1997, Cargill Argentina added a Selection Plant to its premises in Alejandro Roca, which then became a model peanut complex. 
<br />
<br />
The new plant was equipped with the latest technology and operated by personnel trained both locally and abroad.   
<br />
<br />
Following the rapid changes in the business world, the constant mergers and the need to maintain the acquired leadership, Cargill and Golden Peanut in USA decided to fuse in order to operate in the peanut industry of USA and Argentina as of July, 2000. 
<br />
<br />
Golden Peanut, whose owners were Gold Kist, ADM and Alimenta, increased its capital by incorporating the installations of Cargill in USA and Argentina. Now its owners were four, each one with 25% of the capital. With this operation, Golden Peanut started as a multinational company. 
<br />
<br />
In Argentina, the absorption implied the continuity of all personnel and the maintenance of the current policies and principles, and consolidated growth chances.   It also implied the maintenance of the quality assurance system through compliance with the ISO 9001 Standard.   
<br />
<br />
During 2002, the companies Gold Kist and Cargill ended their participation, selling their stocks to Alimenta and ADM, now the sole owners of the Golden Peanut Company, each with a 50-percent contribution in the total investment. 
Understanding that the geographical position of the peanut area is one of the keys to successfully handle every harvest, in 2004, Golden Peanut Argentina signed a lease-purchase agreement for the conditioning and stockpile plant in the community of Chucul. Eventually, after 3 years using it, Golden Peanut Argentina purchased the plant. 
<br />
<br />
Addressing the need to improve the storage capabilities, during 2008, the raw material and treated product depots were enlarged, significantly improving the logistics of the overall operation.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of 2011, ADM is constituted like unique owner of Golden Peanut Company.
